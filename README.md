# Raniel Encarnacion - Portfolio Website

ðŸš€ **Live at: https://ranielencarnacion.github.io/**

Hey! I'm a 4th year Information Systems student who got bit by the web development bug about 2 years ago. This portfolio is basically my digital diary of projects, mistakes, and those "aha!" moments that make coding so addictive.

## What's This About?
This is my personal portfolio where I show off the stuff I've built while learning web development. Started simple with HTML/CSS, now I'm playing with React and TypeScript (still figuring out some of the advanced stuff, but hey, we're getting there!).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with smooth animations
- **Contact Form**: Integrated with Formspree for email notifications
- **Interactive Sections**: Hero, About, Skills, Education, Certifications, Major Projects, and Contact
- **Project Gallery**: Interactive modal galleries showcasing system screenshots
- **AI Assistant**: Added a chatbot because why not? (Still tweaking it)
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Theme switching capability
- **Personal Touch**: Tried to make it feel like me, not just another template

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Deployment Ready**: Static site generation
